# goldenBot
A python bot that gets the golden codes given by key-drop.com from social medias (twitter) and sends it back to a telegram bot 

   This bot can:-
   x. Search for tweets containing golden codes
   1. Send a message with a key-drop code to a channel (maybe telegram) 
   2. access a site called key-drop, wich allows you to input a golden code
   3. Trys to input a key-drop code (if no captcha was received)

Obs: It's kinda of an old code, so feel free to update the links and paths to access the objects on the site. I might get to it later and push some updates
